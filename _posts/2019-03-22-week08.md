The current status of Cassandra Documentation is that it is missing alot of articles for Archeitecture. So our mission is to get those docs written in a clear and concise manner. Our group has decided to implement a Weekly Sprint where we have 2-3 goals that we want to accomplish by the end of the week. For the next week and a half, the goals of the sprint are to first re-read and understand chapters 6,7 and maybe 8 of the Cassandra: The Definitive Edition published by O'Reily. The main focus is on Chapter 7 which discusses the Archeitecture. Obviously, we won't learn absoluetly everything but since we are in the group, some people will pick on subjects easier than others and they can assist other members. The next goal is to make first contact with the community members and get introduced to how they operate in terms of open up issues and pull requests and asking who to go to for certain tasks. The last goals which is slated for the end of the week is to start drafting up the issue request that we will make. That will be very collaborative as I assume we will assign different topics to people who know them the most.
