# Questions of the Week

In your blog, post the URLs of the pages in which you made the edits and describe how you decided on which edits to make.

This week I actually made my first ever contributions to Wikipedia. They were mostly small edits to some citations and adding missing references. I decided on my choices based on the Needs Fixing page that was shown in the Wikipedia presentation we had last week. I didn't feel comfortable yet to just pick a random article and find something myself to fix. I wanted some guidelines first so I looked through the Needs Fixing page to see the kinds of fixes that uses report on. I saw alot of needs 'Wikipeding' or article needs shortening which was interesting to me. I want to see how those things are done because their was a request to 'wikipedify' one of my favorite movies that came out last year, Dragon Ball Super: Broly. Fixing up that article will probably be my next contribution.
