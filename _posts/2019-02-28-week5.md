# Questions Of The Week

 -  Investigating which open source projects you are interested in, and come up with a list of at most three projects.


-----


To start this week, we listened to a presentation by Christos Bacharakis who works mentoring students on how to get involved in the open source community at Mozilla. I must say I really enjoyed the presenatation more then I expected. Usually when I'm at talks either the presenter is boring or the topic itself is boring, but this presentation had the best of both world. I knew Mozilla was more then just a web browser but I didn't know how far they were commited to contributing to open source projects for their goal of keeping the Internet free and accessible to everyone. Might be the last time I use Google Chrome for a minute.
