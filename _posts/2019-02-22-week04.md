# Questions Of The Week

 - Comment on your experience with the project evaluation assignment. For example, was it useful? Was it very time-consuming? How would you assess the activity level of a project? Can you propose other ways of doing this? Try to back up your ideas with some reasons.

Meh.

That sums up my feelings in regards to the project evaluation assignment. It was more busy work then anything. Mostly due those two questions regarding how long do pull requests and issues stay open which forced us go through each pull request or issues and do some basic arthemetic. That took FOREVER.

However, this activity allowed me to explore Github more and click on things that I usually never pay attention to. For example, I have rarely ever clicked on the Insights tab even on repos that I work on at my job. I can see that Dependenacy graph being useful in possible future projects if a community forgets to document certain dependenices that the graph will be able to catch.


The biggest factor to assess the activity level of a project to me is simply just seeing how many pull requests and issues are being opened in the last 3 months. The strongest sign of an active community is how involved people are. Depending on how developed the project may be, there may or may not be alot of active on it in certain areas like bugs or feature requests.

Also I noticed how the more people are involved as code contributors specifically, the more issues and pull requests were being created. That may not be true in all cases, but just from at the projects assigned to us for evaluations that seemed to be the case and it makes sense. The more people are coding, the more ideas for features and fixes will get created as PRs.
