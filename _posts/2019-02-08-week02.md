Personally, I think the best way to first contribute to an open source project is by first helping to develop the documentation so that readable enough so that the average person can at least coprehend. Sometimes I run into really cool projects or tools that I want to use but the documenation is either non-existent or it is really vague to the point where I have to dig into the code itself to figure out the function of certain classes and their methods. 

The type of project that I want to contribute to is something like (https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-server)  where it is an open source alternative program to an existing application. Also a project in a language that I am trying to get more profiecient in. For example Go, Scala or Julia (Python alternative for data science stuff) Most likely submit some bug fixes and possible adding a new feature that Slack and other messaging apps may not have.
