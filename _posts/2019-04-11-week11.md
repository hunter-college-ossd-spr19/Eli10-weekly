I would say it's pretty obvious that understanding the personality types of the people who are working with makes for better collaboration and reaching the goal that everyone is trying to achieve. It is also important when it comes to distributing tasks for people to do. Some personality types work better when they are doing things by themselves or with other matching personality types. I ended up taking an online Myers-Briggs personality test to figure out my type. I ended up being classified as the Logistician (ISTJ-T) which the most abundant type in the around sitting at 13%. Basically, the test concluded that I am a hard-working, dependable introvert who takes pride in their work who doesn't believe in lucky numbers....Sounds about right.
