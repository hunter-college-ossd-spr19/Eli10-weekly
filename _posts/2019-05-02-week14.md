# Questions of the Week

Explain (in your own words) the difference between software development following the cathedral model and software development following the bazaar model. Having spent some time now in the bazaar style of development, which of the two environments do you personally prefer?

The difference between software development following the catherdral model and the bazzar model mainly has to do with freedom and hierarchy. What I mean by saying that is the catherdral model is the typical organizational model you see in 99.9% of places where you have a defined leader or group of leaders who make the final decisions when it comes to any changes and direct everyone else on what to do next. In contrast, the baazar model is non-hierarchial meaning there is no definitive leader and people can make contributions to what ever they want to work on. 

In terms of what I personally prefer, it depends on what I am working on. Sometimes I am doing work to achieve a goal while other times I doing work just for my personal liking. Each environment serves their purpose. The bazaar model seems more for projects that you have a high interest in and in reality I am rarely doing an activity just for the sake of enjoying. Typically I have specific goals in mind and ways to achieve them. Also I have had bad experiences collaborating on activities when there was not clear direction and goals to be met.
