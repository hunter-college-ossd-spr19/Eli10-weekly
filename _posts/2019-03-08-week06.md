So we got the dream team with Shane, Roy and Svetleen (Lo siento :pray:	if I misspelled your name) working on making  a contribution the Apache Cassandra open source project. It's basically a database used for store large amounts of data split up between different groups of machines called clusters. I'm pretty psyched to get started. Working on this projects correlates well into my Big Data class that I am currently taking.

Before we can really dive into the project, we have to complete some preliminary tasks first such as learning how this database works and for me personally to review some Java concepts. Java was the primary language that I learned in my previous school but it has been a while. The first kind of contributions that we can make to the project is the lack of Documentation. Shane mentioned before how there is not alot of documentation for Apache Cassandra that we can easily make a impact on. Besides that I took a look at some of issues reported, and there is alot of easy to medium leveled bugs that we can fix once we get accumulated to the code base. For example [Issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/CASSANDRA/issues/CASSANDRA-15044) deals with an exception being thrown for a query in code but not in the command line interface. So there is some type of mismatch that we would have to figure out. Side Note: The community seems to reported and track issues on JIRA instead of Github. I guess they deem JIRA to have better features to do bug tracking. Finally we probably set up some testing since, users can getting exceptions issues like the one mentioned previously.
