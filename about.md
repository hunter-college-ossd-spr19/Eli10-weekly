Hello, My name Elijah but you can just call me Eli. This is my second to last semester at Hunter. I work at a tech startup on 34th street called SecurityScorecard. We operated in the growing indeustry of security ratings. I started off as an intern back in 2016 and they keep me onboard as full-time employee 9 months later. It has been a awesome experience learning so my things hands on. So I split my time between work and school.
